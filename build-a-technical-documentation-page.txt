            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.</p> 
            <p>Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.</p> 
            <p> JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. </p> 
            <p>JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. 
              </p>
              <p> JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
<p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).</p> <code>$, </code> <code>7,</code> <code> letter,</code> <code>_letter</code>
<p> Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
<code>UPPERCASE,lowercase</code>
<ul>
  <li>Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.</li>
